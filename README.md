# ml_models

The ml_models repository contains java and python packages that implement and test machine learning models. 

The java package "sonet" implements the SOM model (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map) and the GNG model (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_gas).
The java packages "sontest" and "showres" allow to test the SOM and GNG self organizing models on a two-dimensional data sample and display the results of their classification on the screen. 

The "py_sonet" package contains a python implementation of the SOM and GNG models.
